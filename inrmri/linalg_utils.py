def gram_schmidt(vectors):
  """Implementation of the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm.

  Obtained from: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/62828#issuecomment-2379030651
  Modified to work also in complex matrixs.

  We assume here that the vectors are linearly independent. Zero vectors will be
  left unchanged, but will also consume an iteration against `num_vectors`.

  From [1]: "MGS is numerically equivalent to Householder QR factorization
  applied to the matrix A augmented with a square matrix of zero elements on
  top."

  Historical note, see [1]: "modified" Gram-Schmidt was derived by Laplace [2],
  for elimination and not as an orthogonalization algorithm. "Classical"
  Gram-Schmidt actually came later [2]. Classical Gram-Schmidt has a sometimes
  catastrophic loss of orthogonality for badly conditioned matrices, which is
  discussed further in [1].
